why linux? 
It is Free, Secure,Opensource, Multiple Distributions, fast

Architecure Linux os:
1)Heart of linux is Kernal    (kernal is responsible for device management,memory management, process management, handling system related calls)
2) on top kernel we have system libraries  (they are responsible for performing a task example: libc is one of the system library)
3) on top of system libraries, we have compilers,         we have soem user proccesses  , we have system software  (if we want java we need java compilers etc)
