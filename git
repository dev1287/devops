SVN,CVN is centralized (single point of failure)
git is distributed



.git folder contents:
objects: every file we create inside git is treated as objects
hooks: using hooks we stop some one unintentially commiting password and api tokens using hooks we can prevent them.
config: it is ued to config git credentials, certificates
head:
ref:



git diff : to find the difference in changes
git log :to see our commits history
git log <branchname>
git log --oneline: to see commits in one line

git reset --hard <commitid>     : to move to that commit id that has been commited, if we give previous commit id all code will show that commit id code.



git remove -v : to see remote repository
git remote add "location github/bucket"
git clone: to pull code from git repository.  ( we can download by https by password, or by ssh using publickey)



questions:
fork and clone difference?
fork is used clone the repository , clone is used toi download the repository


Testing should be done in same branch oly

to merge branches:

git cherry-pick <commitid> : this will merge that commit id to main branch.
Merge: Creates a merge commit and combines the histories of two branches.
Rebase: Reapplies commits on top of another base tip, creating a cleaner, linear history.
